This is my first post on my new site written in Markdown and built in Jekyll.  I am still getting used to the Jekyll workflow, but overall I enjoy it.   

#### WHY Jekyll?

* Jekyll is built for developers
* A git workflow
* Hosted on Github  


This site is still very much in flux, so except many more changes.
