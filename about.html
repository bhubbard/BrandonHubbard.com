  <h1 class="page-title">About</h1>

  <p>I am a web developer for imFORZA, a small startup based out of beautiful El Segundo, CA. When I am not coding or commuting on the 405 listening to TWIT, I love to travel to far places or snowboard the local slopes. I also enjoy long walks with my dog Dash. This site was hand-coded in Coda, built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub.</p>
